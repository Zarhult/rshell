rshell is a simple shell created collaboratively by me and a classmate for CS100 at UCR. It supports execution of commands in $PATH and standard bash connectors like `&&`, `||`, and `;`, as well as IO redirection/piping with `<`, `>`, and `|`. There is also a `test` function to check whether a file exists with the `-e` flag, whether a file is a directory with the `-d` flag, and whether a file is a regular file with the `-f` flag. For example, `test -d src` would return true in the repo's root directory. The syntax `[ -e src ]` is also supported. Parentheses are supported for control of precedence, and quotes can be used as in `echo "hi"`. Finally, anything after a `#` is treated as a comment and ignored.
