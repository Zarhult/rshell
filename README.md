rshell is a simple shell created collaboratively by me and a classmate for CS100 at UCR. It supports execution of commands in $PATH and standard bash connectors like `&&`, `||`, and `;`, as well as IO redirection with `<`, `>`, `|` and a `test` function to check whether a file exists with the `-e` flag, whether a file is a directory with the `-d` flag, and whether a file is a regular file with the `-f` flag. For example, `test -d src` would return true in the repo's root directory. The syntax `[ -e src ]` is also supported.
